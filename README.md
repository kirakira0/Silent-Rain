# Silent-Rain
An eerie visual novel about murder, racism, and the American incarceration system.   

Gameplay: “Silent Rain” is a video game which utilizes the player’s choices to tell a story. The decisions made by the player influence 
the narrative and lead to the player achieving one of the four different endings. “Silent Rain” is structured as a mystery, where the 
player is thrown into a strange world and must use clues from different character’s dialogue to understand the grim situation of the main 
character and his deuteragonists. As the player completes more of the routes, more is revealed to him or her, and while the game is 
purposely left in part to interpretation, the core plot and themes of “Silent Rain” (which are described below) make themselves clear 
overtime.   

Game Setting/Plot: Calder Ayton gets a call early one morning to pick up his friend, Luka, whom Calder long thought was executed on Death 
Row. The two are residents of the District of Eburnean -- a place where if someone commits murder, their skin fall off. Calder and Luka 
struggle to find a way to rebuild their lives after the time Luka spent awaiting trial in prison and the many years Calder spent as a 
Death Row executioner, during which he lost everything except his eyes. The relationship and fate of the two are up to the player as 
“Silent Rain” explores mass incarceration, racism, and the role of police through a bizarre and eerie psychological thriller.
